# underhack

The Goal of UnderHack is to combine Underscore and LoDash as much as possible with Underscore as the baseline. 
I would like to make them as cross compatiable. Ideally, all functions from each should do essentially the same thing. 
Tests should cover what Underscore and Lodash both cover (plus more if applicable)

| func  | Code  | Test |
|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
| each  | * [ ] | [ ] |
| * [ ] | xxxx  | xxxxx|
